# Reasonate
__Reasonate is an educational application program that aims at
simplifying and improving the online teaching, mainly in mathematics
and similar sciences. The platform is designed to engage students
in being active in the learning process and reduce distractions
and complications usually associated with online teaching.__

## Key Concepts
### Online Interactive Space
Although the application can be used offline for individuals
for exploring and visualizing mathematics, it is first and foremost
designed to connect students and teachers in _spaces_. The spaces
are made for students to navigate and interact with, while the teacher
can manage manipulation of the space and the content within.
Similar to in real classrooms, the teacher can allow students
to manipulate the room and content in a safe way, giving the 
students the opportunity to partake in the classes.

### Objects
Everything inside the spaces are _objects_. Objects can be anything
from a drawn line, a drawn diagram, to functions and graphs.
Some objects have special properties, like functions, which can be
visualized as graphs in the space coordinate system. A standard
set of objects come embedded with the software, but custom objects
can be designed and programmed by teachers. This makes Reasonate
highly adaptive, as it can be tailored for specific courses.

### Object Shelf
The _object shelf_ provides an intuitive way of storing objects.
Once an object is created, most of them are put on this shelf,
providing a natural and intuitive way of organizing created objects.
In order to work with an object, the object can be dragged of the
shelf and into the space. Once in the space, the shelf keeps a 
reference to the object, making it easy to access if one loses the
object in the vast space.

### Pipelines
Some objects take inputs and/or outputs. In such cases, a _pipeline_
can be created for these objects. A pipeline lets you connect the
output of one object to the input of another. To do this as
intuitively as possible, the _output socket_ of one object in the
space is dragged into the _input socket_ of another. This lets
students explore how different processes can be put together to
create more complex systems. Custom objects can also be used in these
pipelines.
